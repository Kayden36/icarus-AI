# About
ICARUS is not just an AI Agent, it's an AI orchestrator abstracting complex inbuilt precision microservices & regulatory bureaucracy to provide easy guidance for users in underserved areas to access solar power, track their carbon offsets and earn connectivity credits in form of SMS, Voice & Data microbundles. 
## Overview 
![icarus](Media/IMG-20250123-WA0137.jpg)]This model is tailored to cater the rising adoption of solar energy in southern Africa which has been hit with a 1200MW drought induced Hydropower deficits. ICARUS AI Bot is designed to run on vgrid & abstract users away from the complexities of photovoltaic based carbon offsetting model, carbon credits & GHG emissions avoided by using solar energy by simply carbon offsets into connectivity credits to provide connectivity on demand in form of Data, SMS or Voice. 
The goal is to incentivise sustainable living and digital inclusion in off-grid communities while disrupting the $1.5Billion Carbon markets.

## iCARUS AI - Enhanced Contextual Realtime Awareness, Adaptability & Precision
ICARUS AI is able to deliver high precision data and insights using JavaScript Drones (microservices wrapped in gutenberg blocks), each dedicated to fetch Real-Time Precise ACF data optimizing & enhancing prompts for ICARUS in the following ways:
- Tracking solar node performance
- Monitoring live offsets
- Managing rewards balances
- Handling user requests and inquiries
 
## Knowledge Base
This project utilizes the following datasets:
- Metadata Analysis & Feedback login
- Inbuilt Javascript Microservices
- VGrid Solar Maps & webscraping
- Global Electricity Grid Dataset (World Bank)
- NASA Infrared Night Lights Satellite Datasets
- Giga Schools Connectivity Dataset
- Ooni: To test connectivity in any mobile network
