# Transforming Carbon Credits into Connectivity for underserved Communities 
This prototype demonstrates how an AI Agent helps empower off-grid communities with connectivity in form of SMS, Voice & Data microbundles using Carbon Credits generated when CO2 Emissions are avoided by consuming Solar Power. 

# Introduction 
Connectivity remains poor in regions such as Southern Africa despite abundant sustainable energy resources, in particular solar energy and photovoltaics with rich carbon offsetting potential. This AI model is designed to abstract away from the complex carbon crediting mechanisms and GHG mitigation bureaucracy by seamlessly aggregating solar output, track carbon offsets to generate "CONNECTIVITY CREDITS" from carbon markets which have remained exclusive to large corporations. ICARUS AI is poised to easily disrupt this status quo, in a fun conversational manner.

# KNOWLEDGE BASE
# Global Electricity Grid
Description: A global map of electricity transmission and distribution lines, derived using the Gridfinder model. This dataset provides insights into existing grid infrastructure worldwide, enabling better planning for energy solutions.
Source: World Bank
Link: World Bank Data Catalog

# Potential Use:
ICARUS can use this dataset to identify areas underserved by the grid, helping guide decisions on deploying solar panels and off-grid solutions.
Provides users with infrastructure insights to plan energy access projects in remote or underdeveloped regions.
