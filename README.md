# ICARUS - AI Powered Connectivity For Underserved Regions Using Carbon Offsetting Model
This prototype demonstrates how an AI Agent helps empower off-grid communities with connectivity in form of SMS, Voice & Data microbundles using Carbon Credits generated when CO2 Emissions are avoided by consuming Solar Power. 
iCARUS AI is deployed on https://vgridafrica.com, a gamified web application which measures solar power usage and carbon emissions avoided & rewards users with connectivity credits that can be redeemed as SMS, Data & Voice bundles on demand. 

ICARUS AI is designed to abstract away from the complex mechanism behind this process to help users seamlessly connect their solar units to earn & reap the rewards in a fun conversational manner.

KNOWLEDGE BASE
